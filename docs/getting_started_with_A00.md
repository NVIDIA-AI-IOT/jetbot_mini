# Getting Started with A00

**A00 IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR MANUFACTURE; this documentation is more to show how I setup the A00 Jetbot Minis and as a reference for A01.**

To get setup with the Jetbot Mini, please step through the hardware and software setup. 

If you would like to learn more about the design of the Jetbot Mini, I recommend checking out the [board design](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetbot_mini/tree/main/docs/board_design), [chassis](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetbot_mini/tree/main/docs/chassis) and [software](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetbot_mini/tree/main/docs/software) documentation.

The KiCAD design files are located [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetbot_mini/tree/main/design).

The Onshape chassis design files are located [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetbot_mini/tree/main/assets/chassis). 

The software files are located [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetbot_mini/tree/main/jetbot). 

Happy Jetbot Mini'ing!
