# 3D Printing Guide

I personally like using Cura to slice and prep stl files for printing. 
I used the Ender 3 to print out the necessary chassis files. 
Once Cura is downloaded, go through the following steps to print: 

1. Open Cura, click on the upper left folder icon and choose the stl file that you want to print.

</p>

2. Change the printer to match your printer; in my case its the Ender 3.

3. Change the print settings; I like to use 0.25 mm layer height, 30% infill density, and enable support. Then click "Slice" on the lower right.

</p>

4. Plug in a micro-sd card and save the sliced stl file to the sd card. This dialogue box shows you printing time and the amount of filament used.

5. You can check what will be printed by clicking "preview" at the top.

6. Eject the micro-sd card, place it in your printer, and print!

## Do the following steps if you need to change the orientation of an stl file

1. Click on the CAD file that you need to change the orientation of.

</p>

2. Click on the third icon on the left ribbon and drag the corresponding circle in the direction you want to orient the CAD. In this case I dragged the green circle to the right.

3. Proceed with steps 3, 4, and 5.
