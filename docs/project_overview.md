The [Jetbot](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetbot) is a self-driving robot that harnesses neural networks, a camera, motors, and the Jetson Nano module to do cool things like follow roads and avoid obstacles. It is a fantastic learning tool for hobbyists, students and makers to get familiar with neural networks and AI. 

This project, the Jetbot Mini, is meant as a smaller iteration of the [Jetbot](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetbot) with a new custom baseboard with an integrated motor controller and battery charger to reduce cost and wire clutter when assembling. The main design goal was to achieve two-way traffic on the LEGO roads used to test the original Jetbot; this goal is meant to facilitate a cool demo and prove how custom baseboards can result in optimizations for these kinds of projects.

The overall goal and ethos of this project is to make all the design files open source and provide an example of custom hardware for the Jetson Nano module that makers, students, and hobbyists can learn from and either improve the design, or use it to help them create their own custom hardware. You are encouraged to download the design files and play around with them! 

> As mentioned in the overall README, the A00 baseboard is not recommended for manufacture as the boards have not been fully validated and require an extensive rework to work properly. A01, the next iteration of the schematic, is currently being worked on. 

Another design goal was to make the Jetbot Mini cheaper to manufacture, although that is currently being worked. More information can be found in the bill_of_materials.md file.
