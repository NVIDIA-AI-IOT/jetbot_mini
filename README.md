</p>

This is the Jetbot Mini project, a smaller iteration of the [Jetbot](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetbot)! Some key features are as follows:
* Onboard motor controller and battery charger to reduce costs and wire clutter
* Custom baseboard for the Jetson Nano module
* A smaller chassis that can achieve two way traffic on the LEGO roads used to test the original Jetbot
* Designed with KiCAD and Onshape for easy maker access

This project aims to be an accessible example project that uses the Jetson Nano platform and a custom baseboard, so any feedback about the design is welcome. 

**Please note that the A00 Baseboard design is not recommended for manufacture, as it requires a rework to work properly and some features have not been fully validated. The A01 Baseboard is currently in development that aims to fix issues found with A00.**
