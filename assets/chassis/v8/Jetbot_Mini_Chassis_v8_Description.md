This chassis is among the thinnest designs, but has a turning issue as when looking from the back of the chassis, the center of mass is shifted slightly to the right due to the way the baseboard and Jetson Nano Module is mounted. Thus the left motor doesn't get enough traction with the ground, resulting in the robot having trouble turning right. 

Note that this chassis design can potentially be improved by removing the fan and thus shifting the center of mass towards the center, improving the robot's ability to turn.
