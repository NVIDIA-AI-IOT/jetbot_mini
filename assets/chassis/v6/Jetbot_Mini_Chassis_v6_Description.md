This chassis uses a horizontally mounted baseboard design, but is too long and thus fails the two-way traffic LEGO road specification. However, this design can potentially be optimized further with smaller wheels and a smaller battery, and thus is a good reference design. Also note that this designs uses the baseboard in the intended way, with the motors below the baseboard to connect easily to the motor headers.
